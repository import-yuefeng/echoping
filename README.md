# echoping

A golang network utility using TCP & UDP messages to detect network stability.

## Why to write this network utility

It's difficult to detect network problems in real life. 

`echoping` uses TCP and UDP protocols instead of ICMP used by traditional `ping`, and send messages more frequently.

`echoping` works more like a real network application, and reports network problems as the real one.


## How it works

1. Start a `echoping` server by `./echoping -listen IP:PORT`
2. Start `echoping` clients to use the `echoping` server: `./echoping -connect SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT`
3. Every `echoping` client sends TCP and/or UDP requests to the server
4. The server sends every request as a response back to the client
5. The client collects the responses and calculates the packet loss ratio (UDP only) and round-trip time
6. If any network error occurs, the client will retry to connect and send requests forever. 
7. Every connection (ping session) has a unique session id which is generated by the connection time, it helps to distinguish different client connections, eg: if a network error occurs and a client re-connects, then there will be a new session id in logs.

Usage:

```
  -connect string
        connect to 'tcp://ip:port/,udp://ip:port/' (can be repeated, use comma as delimiter), or use 'ip:port' for both TCP and UDP
  -listen string
        listen both TCP and UDP on ip:port
  -listen-tcp string
        listen TCP on ip:port
  -listen-udp string
        listen UDP on ip:port
  -ping-interval duration
        the interval between ping requests sent by client (default 20ms)
```

Server output:
```
2020/12/26 01:24:54 server stat udp:127.0.0.1:52032 (20201226-012449.458182): pps=10.0, tmperr=0
2020/12/26 01:24:54 server stat tcp:127.0.0.1:56524 (20201226-012449.458231): pps=10.0, tmperr=0
```

Client output:
```
2020/12/26 01:24:54 client stat udp:127.0.0.1:12345 (20201226-012449.458182): pps=11.0, loss=0.0%, round-trip time (ms): avg=0.4, min=0.2, max=0.6, stddev=0.1
2020/12/26 01:24:54 client stat tcp:127.0.0.1:12345 (20201226-012449.458231): pps=11.0, loss=0.0%, round-trip time (ms): avg=0.3, min=0.2, max=0.4, stddev=0.1
```

* "20201226-012449.458182" is the ping session id, which is generated by the time of the client starts the ping session.
* `pps` means "ping per second"
* TCP's `loss` is always 0% (of course)

## Develop and debug locally

```
./echoping -listen :12345 -connect 127.0.0.1:12345
```
